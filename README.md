# BLDC-DRIVER

BLDC-DRIVER usually uses for driving brusless DC motor. Brusless DC motor has three input, these inputs connect to inductors. Rotor of the motor has permenant magnet,
When inputs are energized, Temporarly magnet are occured and interaction which is between permenant and temporarly magnets poles are occured. You can design two kind driver as half bridge 
and full bridge, actually these drivers are working same priciple but there is one difference between them which is while Full bridge driver can energized one coil, It can unenergized 
opposite pole at the same time. Thus system is more efficient. But Half bridge driver can effect just one coil at the same time. For more understanding, you can observe
